Assume a client wants to receive some number of chunks, starting at some chunk offset. The response data is defined with the same technique as for the <a data-ref="baseline" data-preview-anchor="/bab/previews/baseline.html?def§baseline" data-hl="true" href="#baseline">baseline verifiable stream</a>: the transmission of each chunk <em>in the slice</em> is preceded by the labels of the left and right children of all inner vertices on the path from the root of the tree to that chunk. Chunks outside the slice do not contribute any data. Again, each label is transmitted at most once. Since the length of the slice is known to the client, the response need not be prefixed by the length. We call this transmission the <dfn id="baseline_chunk"><a data-ref="baseline_chunk" data-preview-anchor="/bab/previews/baseline_chunk.html?def§baseline_chunk" data-hl="true" href="#baseline_chunk">baseline verifiable chunk stream</a></dfn>. <a class="figure" data-ref="fig_stream_slice" data-preview-anchor="/bab/previews/fig_stream_slice.html?def§fig_stream_slice" href="#fig_stream_slice">Figure&nbsp;4</a> shows an example of which data needs to be transmitted when the client requests three chunks, starting at offset two (zero-indexed).</p></div></body></html>
