BLAKE3 supports an unbounded degree of parallelism, using a tree structure that scales up to any number of SIMD lanes and CPU cores. On Intel Cascade Lake-SP, peak single-threaded throughput is 4× that of BLAKE2b, 8× that of SHA-512, and 12× that of SHA-256, and it can scale further using multiple threads. BLAKE3 is also efficient on smaller architectures: throughput on a 32-bit ARM1176 core is 1.3× that of SHA-256 and 3× that of BLAKE2b and SHA-512. Unlike BLAKE2 and SHA-2, with different variants better suited for different platforms, BLAKE3 is a single algorithm with no variants. It provides a simplified API supporting all the use cases of BLAKE2, including keying and extendable output. The tree structure also supports new use cases, such as verified streaming and incremental updates.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
